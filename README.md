# DRF E-commerce

This is a sample project of an e-commerce API developed using Django Rest Framework (DRF).

The idea is to show the use of some packages that can be used in future projects:

- pytest
- pytest-django
- flake8
- django-mptt
- drf-spectacular
- coverage
- pytest-cov
- pytest-factorybot
